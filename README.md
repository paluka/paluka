I am a full stack developer (React + Node + GCP/AWS) and currently working at Nuvalence. I also have professional experience building a Roku OTT app (BrightScript), and component libraries for React Native and iOS Swift.
- ðŸ”­ I have spent over four years working in a computer science research lab where I conducted research in the areas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Information Visualization, including designing and creating and then conducting research studies on:
  - a multi-touch tabletop application for language learning
    - [TandemTable link](http://vialab.science.uoit.ca/portfolio/tandemtable)
  - a multi-touch computing Java component library to make it easier for people to create prototypes and conduct research
    -  [Simple Multi-Touch (SMT) Toolkit link](http://vialab.science.uoit.ca/portfolio/smt-toolkit)
  - a system for off-screen interaction that is based on spatial user input (mid-air gestures) to offload content into the space around the screen  and making them available using information visualization and exploration techniques
